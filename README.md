# Machine-Learning

Classification task: I used Machine Learning techniques on data from customers of an insurance company who have taken out health insurance to predict whether they might be interested in car insurance provided by the same company. 

Regression task: I used regression techniques to predict the transcoding time of a video based on several parameters (duration, bitrate, size, codec, etc) of both, input and output compression format.
